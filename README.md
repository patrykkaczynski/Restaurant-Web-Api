# :information_source: General Info
The purpose of the project was to create a web api which enables CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for restaurants and their lists of dishes. The program includes user registration and log-in, handling an authentication process by using JWT token (JSON Web Token) in this way. Every user is authorized based on its role or custom policy in order to check its privileges to specific endpoints in the application. Additionally, as a part of the training, downloading a file from server and sending a file to server have been implemented in the program.

The project has been created based on practical course on Udemy platform in order to understand the principle of operation of every web application and what elements it should consist of. The important aspect of learning was integration of the program with database by using Entity Framework Core.
